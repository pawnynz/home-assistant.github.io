The `arlo` implementation allows you to integrate your [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/) devices in Home Assistant.

To enable device linked in your [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/) account, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
arlo:
  username: you@example.com
  password: secret
```

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): The username for accessing your Arlo account.
- **password** (*Required*): The password for accessing your Arlo account.

It is recommended to create a dedicated user on Arlo website to be used within Home Assistant and then share your Arlo cameras.  Ensure you enable "Allow Access Rights" on this account.

Finish its configuration by visiting the [Arlo sensor page](/components/sensor.arlo/) or [Arlo camera page](/components/camera.arlo/) or [Arlo control panel page](/components/alarm_control_panel.arlo/).

The Arlo component also provides a service to enable/disable the motion detection sensor. The example below enables the motion detection every time the Home Assistant service starts.

```yaml
#automation.yaml
- alias: Enable Arlo upton HA start'
  initial_state: 'on'
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: camera.enable_motion_detection
    entity_id: camera.arlo_frontdoor
```
